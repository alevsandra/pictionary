# Pictionary
A Pictionary game built with a convolutional neural network as a web application in Django. I used PyTorch to create a neural network. For database I used ["Quick, Draw!"](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) dataset and another one collected by my other Django app, [pictionary_db](https://github.com/alevsandra/pictionary_db).
